# Flask App

I am using Flask, Pandas and Bokeh to manipulate and plot data from Quandl.

The dataset is described here: https://www.quandl.com/data/GUARDIAN/ANIMAL_TESTING-Scientific-procedures-on-animals-UK

The app has been deployed with Heroku. It can be accessed here: http://murmuring-mesa-5485.herokuapp.com/index
